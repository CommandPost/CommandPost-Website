# System Requirements

!!!warning Important Change
**CommandPost v2** now requires at least **ONE PAID** [LateNite](https://apps.apple.com/au/developer/latenite-films-pty-ltd/id1652018641) application installed.<br />
<br />
After **9 years of free updates**, to ensure that CommandPost continues to be developed, improved, and stay open-source, we've decided that you need at least ONE paid [LateNite](https://apps.apple.com/au/developer/latenite-films-pty-ltd/id1652018641) application installed to use CommandPost moving forward - consider it "inner circle" software (i.e. only our mates get access to it).<br />
<br />
To use **CommandPost v2** please download and install at least **ONE** [LateNite](https://apps.apple.com/au/developer/latenite-films-pty-ltd/id1652018641) application from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/au/developer/latenite-films-pty-ltd/id1652018641). The cheapest is **USD$10**.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can always stay on **CommandPost v1** without updating (you can turn off **Automatically Check for Updates** in the CommandPost's **General Preferences**), or build CommandPost yourself in [Xcode](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost), as it remains completely open source.<br />
<br />
Thank you to **EVERYONE** who has supported CommandPost throughout these years! Onwards & Upwards!<br />
<br />
You can read more about this decision on the [FAQ page](/faq/#why-is-commandpost-no-longer-free).

CommandPost supports **macOS Sequoia 15.1** and later. It works great on **macOS Tahoe v26.2** and later.

It has **native** support for both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

We use Apple’s built-in Accessibility API, which requires both **Accessibility** and **Screen Recording** permissions, so that we can determine window and button positions. You can learn more [here](/faq/#why-does-commandpost-require-screen-recording-permissions).

### Final Cut Pro

### Other Applications

You can use CommandPost to trigger keyboard shortcuts and menubar items on **any** macOS application.

!!!
If you want to access the menubar items of other applications in the CommandPost Search Console, make sure you enable **Scan Running Application Menubars on Startup** and **Scan Running Application Menubars on Startup** in the [General preferences](/preferences/general/). These are options are off by default for performance.

It has basic support for **Adobe After Effects 2020** and later.
