# System Requirements

!!!success Support CommandPost
**CommandPost v2** requires at least ONE paid LateNite App installed.<br />
<br />
After 9 years of free updates, to ensure that CommandPost continues to be developed, improved, and stay open-source, we've decided that you need at least ONE paid LateNite application installed to use CommandPost moving forward - consider it "inner circle" software (i.e. only our mates get access to it).<br />
<br />
Thank you to EVERYONE who has supported CommandPost throughout these years! To use CommandPost v2 (and later) please download and install at least ONE LateNite App from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/au/developer/latenite-films-pty-ltd/id1652018641) OR roll back to a previous version of CommandPost v1.
!!!

CommandPost supports **macOS Sequoia 15.1** and later. It works great on **macOS Tahoe v26.2** and later.

It has **native** support for both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

We use Apple’s built-in Accessibility API, which requires both **Accessibility** and **Screen Recording** permissions, so that we can determine window and button positions. You can learn more [here](/faq/#why-does-commandpost-require-screen-recording-permissions).

### Final Cut Pro

The latest version of CommandPost requires **Final Cut Pro 10.6.5** or later.

It works great on the latest **Final Cut Pro v12** and **Final Cut Pro Creator Studio v12** releases.

**We recommend always using the latest version of Final Cut Pro.**

You can find Final Cut Pro's system requirements [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/111903).

### Other Applications

You can use CommandPost to trigger keyboard shortcuts and menubar items on **any** macOS application.

!!!
If you want to access the menubar items of other applications in the CommandPost Search Console, make sure you enable **Scan Running Application Menubars on Startup** and **Scan Running Application Menubars on Startup** in the [General preferences](/preferences/general/). These are options are off by default for performance.
!!!

It has basic support for **Adobe After Effects 2020** and later.

It has limited experimental support for **DaVinci Resolve 16.2.7** and later. We hope to offer much deeper DaVinci Resolve support in the future.
