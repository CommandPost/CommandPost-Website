# System Requirements

CommandPost supports **macOS Big Sur, Monterey & Ventura**.

It has **native** support for both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

We use Appleâ€™s built-in Accessibility API, which requires both **Accessibility** and **Screen Recording** permissions, so that we can determine window and button positions.

If you're using **Catalina**, you can still access older versions [here](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost/releases/tag/1.4.13).

If you're using **Mojave**, you can still access older versions [here](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost/releases/tag/1.2.16).
