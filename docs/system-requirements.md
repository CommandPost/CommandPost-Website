# System Requirements

CommandPost supports **macOS Big Sur, Monterey & Ventura**.

It has **native** support for both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

We use Appleâ€™s built-in Accessibility API, which requires both **Accessibility** and **Screen Recording** permissions, so that we can determine window and button positions.

If you're using **Catalina**, you can still download [CommandPost v1.4.13](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost/releases/tag/1.4.13){target="_blank"}.

If you're using **Mojave**, you can still download [CommandPost v1.2.16](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost/releases/tag/1.2.16){target="_blank"}.

### Final Cut Pro

The latest version of CommandPost requires **Final Cut Pro 10.6.5** or later. It works great with **Final Cut Pro 10.6.6**.

You can find Final Cut Pro's system requirements [here](https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/specs/){target="_blank"}.

### Other Applications

You can use CommandPost to trigger keyboard shortcuts and menubar items on **any** macOS application.

CommandPost also has deep support for **Final Cut Pro 10.5.4** to **10.6.5**.

It has basic support for **Adobe After Effects 2020** and later.

It has limited experimental support for **DaVinci Resolve 16.2.7** and later. If there's enough interest/sponsorship, we hope to offer much better Resolve support in the future.

If you're using an earlier version of Final Cut Pro, you can use an [older version of CommandPost](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost/releases/tag/1.2.16){target="_blank"}.
