# System Requirements

CommandPost supports **macOS Sequoia 15.1**.

It has **native** support for both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

We use Appleâ€™s built-in Accessibility API, which requires both **Accessibility** and **Screen Recording** permissions, so that we can determine window and button positions. You can learn more [here](/faq/#why-does-commandpost-require-screen-recording-permissions).

### Final Cut Pro

The latest version of CommandPost requires **Final Cut Pro 10.6.5** or later.

It works great on the latest **Final Cut Pro 11** release.

You can find Final Cut Pro's system requirements [here](https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/specs/).

### Other Applications

You can use CommandPost to trigger keyboard shortcuts and menubar items on **any** macOS application.

!!!
If you want to access the menubar items of other applications in the CommandPost Search Console, make sure you enable **Scan Running Application Menubars on Startup** and **Scan Running Application Menubars on Startup** in the [General preferences](/preferences/general/). These are options are off by default for performance.
!!!

It has basic support for **Adobe After Effects 2020** and later.

It has limited experimental support for **DaVinci Resolve 16.2.7** and later. We hope to offer much deeper DaVinci Resolve support in the future.
