Inspect information about the machine Hammerspoon is running on

Notes:
 * The network/hostname calls can be slow, as network resolution calls can be called, which are synchronous and will block Hammerspoon until they complete.

| **Description**                             | Query CPU usage statistics for a given time interval using [hs.host.cpuUsageTicks](#cpuUsageTicks) and return the results as percentages.                                                                     |
| **Parameters**                              | <ul><li>`period`    - an optional value specifying the time between samples collected for calculating CPU usage statistics.
  If `callback` is not provided, this is an optional integer, default 100000, specifying the number of microseconds to block between samples collected.  Note that Hammerspoon will block for this period of time during execution of this function.
  If `callback` is provided, this is an optional number, default 1.0, specifying the number of seconds between samples collected.  Hammerspoon will *not* block during this time period.</li><li>`callback` - an optional callback function which will receive the cpu usage statistics in a table, described below, as its sole argument.</li></ul> |
| **Returns**                                 | <ul><li>If a callback function is not provided, this function will return a table containing the following:</li><li>  Individual tables, indexed by the core number, for each CPU core with the following keys in each subtable:</li><li>    user   -- percentage of CPU time occupied by user level processes.</li><li>    system -- percentage of CPU time occupied by system (kernel) level processes.</li><li>    nice   -- percentage of CPU time occupied by user level processes with a positive nice value. (See notes below)</li><li>    active -- For convenience, when you just want the total CPU usage, this is the sum of user, system, and nice.</li><li>    idle   -- percentage of CPU time spent idle</li><li>  The key `overall` containing the same keys as described above but based upon the average of all cores combined.</li><li>  The key `n` containing the number of cores detected.</li><li>If a callback function is provided, this function will return a placeholder table with the following metamethods:</li><li>  `hs.host.cpuUsage:finished()` - returns a boolean indicating if the second CPU sample has been collected yet (true) or not (false).</li><li>  `hs.host.cpuUsage:stop()`     - abort the sample collection.  The callback function will not be invoked.</li><li>  The results of the cpu statistics will be submitted as a table, described above, to the callback function.</li></ul>          |
| **Notes**                                   | <ul><li>If no callback function is provided, Hammerspoon will block (i.e. no other Hammerspoon activity can occur) during execution of this function for `period` microseconds (1 second = 1,000,000 microseconds).  The default period is 1/10 of a second. If `period` is too small, it is possible that some of the CPU statistics may result in `nan` (not-a-number).</li><li></li><li>For reference, the `top` command has a default period between samples of 1 second.</li><li></li><li>The subtables for each core and `overall` have a __tostring() metamethod which allows listing it's contents in the Hammerspoon console by typing `hs.host.cpuUsage()[#]` where # is the core you are interested in or the string "overall".</li></ul>                |

| **Parameters**                              | <ul><li>None</li></ul> |
| **Returns**                                 | <ul><li>A table containing the following:</li><li>  Individual tables, indexed by the core number, for each CPU core with the following keys in each subtable:</li><li>    user   -- number of ticks the cpu core has spent in user mode since system startup.</li><li>    system -- number of ticks the cpu core has spent in system mode since system startup.</li><li>    nice   </li><li>    active -- For convenience, when you just want the total CPU usage, this is the sum of user, system, and nice.</li><li>    idle   -- number of ticks the cpu core has spent idle</li><li>  The key `overall` containing the same keys as described above but based upon the combined total of all cpu cores for the system.</li><li>  The key `n` containing the number of cores detected.</li></ul>          |
| **Notes**                                   | <ul><li>CPU mode ticks are updated during system interrupts and are incremented based upon the mode the CPU is in at the time of the interrupt. By its nature, this is always going to be approximate, and a single call to this function will return the current tick values since the system was last rebooted.</li><li>To generate a snapshot of the system's usage "at this moment", you must take two samples and calculate the difference between them.  The [hs.host.cpuUsage](#cpuUsage) function is a wrapper which does this for you and returns the cpu usage statistics as a percentage of the total number of ticks which occurred during the sample period you specify when invoking `hs.host.cpuUsage`.</li><li></li><li>Historically on Unix based systems, the `nice` cpu state represents processes for which the execution priority has been reduced to allow other higher priority processes access to more system resources.  The source code for the version of the [XNU Kernel](https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-3789.41.3/) currently provided by Apple (for macOS 10.12.3) shows this value as returned by the `host_processor_info` as hardcoded to 0.  For completeness, this value *is* included in the statistics returned by this function, but unless Apple makes a change in the future, it is not expected to provide any useful information.</li><li></li><li>Adapted primarily from code found at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6785069/get-cpu-percent-usage</li></ul>                |
