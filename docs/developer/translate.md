# Translating CommandPost
---

CommandPost has been designed with internationalisation in mind.

To translate CommandPost to another language visit [POeditor](https://poeditor.com/join/project/QWvOQlF1Sy).

We use [i18n.lua](https://github.com/kikito/i18n.lua) to handle translations.

We currently have a single translation file for each language, which covers both the Extensions & Plugins within CommandPost-App.

If you're developing a plugin, we recommend still using `i18n`, and doing your own translations within the plugin.
