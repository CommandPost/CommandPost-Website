The Finder section in CommandPost settings contains options to change the default behavior of the Finder regarding external drives, chimes, and pasteboard. With these settings, users can customize the way external drives behave within the Finder, set a chime sound when external power is connected, and manage the pasteboard history.

## Drive Management
- **Unmount external drives when switching to battery power**: This checkbox allows you to enable or disable the automatic unmounting of external drives when your computer switches to battery power. When enabled, CommandPost will automatically unmount any external drives that are connected to your computer when your computer switches to battery power.
- **Mount external drives when switching to AC power**: This checkbox allows you to enable or disable the automatic mounting of external drives when your computer switches to AC power. When enabled, CommandPost will automatically mount any external drives that were previously unmounted when your computer switches back to AC power.

## Advanced
- **Play chime sound when laptop power is connected**: This checkbox allows you to enable or disable the chime sound that will play when your laptop's power cable is connected. When enabled, Finder will play a chime sound to alert you that your laptop's power cable is now connected and charging.

## Text Pasteboard History
- **Enable Text Pasteboard History**: This checkbox allows you to enable or disable the text pasteboard history feature in CommandPost. When enabled, CommandPost will keep a history of the text that you have copied and pasted, allowing you to quickly access previous copied text.
- **History Size**: This dropdown menu allows you to set the maximum number of items that will be stored in the text pasteboard history. The default value is 5.
