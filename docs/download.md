!!!warning Important Change
**CommandPost v2** now requires at least **ONE PAID** [LateNite](https://apps.apple.com/au/developer/latenite-films-pty-ltd/id1652018641) application installed.<br />
<br />
After **9 years of free updates**, to ensure that CommandPost continues to be developed, improved, and stay open-source, we've decided that you need at least ONE paid [LateNite](https://apps.apple.com/au/developer/latenite-films-pty-ltd/id1652018641) application installed to use CommandPost moving forward - consider it "inner circle" software (i.e. only our mates get access to it).<br />
<br />
To use **CommandPost v2** please download and install at least **ONE** [LateNite](https://apps.apple.com/au/developer/latenite-films-pty-ltd/id1652018641) application from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/au/developer/latenite-films-pty-ltd/id1652018641).<br />
<br />
There are several applications for sale at **USD$9.99**.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can always stay on **CommandPost v1** without updating (you can turn off **Automatically Check for Updates** in the CommandPost's **General Preferences**), or build CommandPost yourself in [Xcode](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost), as it remains completely open source.<br />
<br />
If you're a film student, indie filmmaker, or you're under financial stress, also feel free to reach out via Discord.<br />
<br />
Thank you to **EVERYONE** who has supported CommandPost throughout these years! Onwards & Upwards!<br />
