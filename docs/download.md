!!!success Support CommandPost
**CommandPost v2** requires at least ONE paid LateNite App installed.<br />
After 9 years of free updates, to ensure that CommandPost continues to be developed, improved, and stay open-source, we've decided that you need at least ONE paid LateNite application installed to use CommandPost moving forward - consider it "inner circle" software (i.e. only our mates get access to it).<br />
Thank you to EVERYONE who has supported CommandPost throughout these years! To use CommandPost v2 (and later) please download and install at least ONE LateNite App from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/au/developer/latenite-films-pty-ltd/id1652018641) OR roll back to a previous version of CommandPost v1.
