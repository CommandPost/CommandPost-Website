# Sponsor CommandPost

To help continue CommandPost to grow, evolve, and stay **open-source**, we offer several ways to sponsor CommandPost's continued development.

Our **preferred method** is [monthly GitHub Sponsorship](#github) - even if it's just a few dollars each month.

!!!warning Important Change
**CommandPost v2** now requires at least **ONE PAID** [LateNite](https://apps.apple.com/au/developer/latenite-films-pty-ltd/id1652018641) application installed.<br />
<br />
After **9 years of free updates**, to ensure that CommandPost continues to be developed, improved, and stay open-source, we've decided that you need at least ONE paid [LateNite](https://apps.apple.com/au/developer/latenite-films-pty-ltd/id1652018641) application installed to use CommandPost moving forward - consider it "inner circle" software (i.e. only our mates get access to it).<br />
<br />
To use **CommandPost v2** please download and install at least **ONE** [LateNite](https://apps.apple.com/au/developer/latenite-films-pty-ltd/id1652018641) application from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/au/developer/latenite-films-pty-ltd/id1652018641). The cheapest is **USD$10**.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can always stay on **CommandPost v1** without updating (you can turn off **Automatically Check for Updates** in the CommandPost's **General Preferences**), or build CommandPost yourself in [Xcode](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost), as it remains completely open source.<br />
<br />
Thank you to **EVERYONE** who has supported CommandPost throughout these years! Onwards & Upwards!<br />
<br />
You can read more about this decision on the [FAQ page](/faq/#why-is-commandpost-no-longer-free).

- **Gyroflow Toolbox** allows you to import Gyroflow Projects into Apple's Final Cut Pro.
- **Marker Toolbox** allows you to import Vimeo CSV, Wipster CSV, Dropbox Replay JSON & Email Comments into Final Cut Pro.

The Mac App Store also supports **Complete My Bundle** - which credits customers for apps they’ve already purchased within a bundle. You only pay the balance for the remaining apps.
