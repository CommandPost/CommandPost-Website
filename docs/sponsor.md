# Sponsor CommandPost

To help continue CommandPost to grow, evolve, and stay completely **free and open-source**, we offer several ways to sponsor CommandPost's development.

Our **preferred method** is [monthly GitHub Sponsorship](#github) - even if it's just a few dollars each month.

### Mac App Store

We also sell several useful paid Final Cut Pro tools on the Mac App Store such as:

- **BRAW Toolbox** allows you to import Blackmagic RAW files directly into Final Cut Pro without transcoding.
- **Gyroflow Toolbox** allows you to import Gyroflow Projects into Apple's Final Cut Pro.
- **Marker Toolbox** allows you to import Vimeo CSV, Wipster CSV, Dropbox Replay JSON & Email Comments into Final Cut Pro.

For only **USD$100** (save USD$49.95!), you can now buy [BRAW Toolbox](https://brawtoolbox.io), [Gyroflow Toolbox](https://gyroflowtoolbox.io), [Marker Toolbox](https://markertoolbox.io), [Recall Toolbox](https://recalltoolbox.io) & [Fast Collections](https://fastcollections.io) as a bundle!

Better yet, for an extra **USD$50**, you can also get [LUT Robot](https://lutrobot.pro) and [Capacitor](https://capacitor.pro) (save USD$119.93)!

The Mac App Store also supports **Complete My Bundle** - which credits customers for apps theyâ€™ve already purchased within a bundle. You only pay the balance for the remaining apps.

You can find the [**Pro Editor Bundle** on the Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app-bundle/id1717681153?mt=12).

You can find the [**Pro Editor Bundle v2** on the Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app-bundle/id1750813030?mt=12).
