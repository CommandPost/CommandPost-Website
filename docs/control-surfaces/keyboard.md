# Keyboard

The most common way of triggering actions in CommandPost is via shortcut keys on your keyboard.

There are two types of shortcuts keys - "All Applications" shortcuts, and application specific shortcuts (currently limited to Final Cut Pro).

"All Applications" shortcuts work anytime Final Cut Pro isn't active, and Final Cut Pro shortcuts only work when Final Cut Pro is active.

When you first install CommandPost, there are a few built-in shortcuts predefined, for example, the following "All Applications" shortcuts are enabled by default:

- **CONTROL + OPTION + COMMAND + SPACE:** Activate Global Console
- **CONTROL + OPTION + COMMAND + L:** Launch Final Cut Pro

There are also built-in shortcuts predefined for Final Cut Pro.

You can customise the shortcuts keys in the **Keyboard** Preferences panel - which can be accessed by pressing the **Control Surfaces** dropdown menu near the bottom of the CommandPost menubar:

This is what the Shortcut Preferences panel looks like:

The top drop-down allows you to select between "All Applications" Shortcuts or application specific shortcuts (currently limited to Final Cut Pro).

The left column (Label), contains all of the Actions available as shortcuts for the selected group, which can be assigned to a modifier and key. A shortcut requires BOTH a modifier and a key to become active.

There is also a **Reset to Default Shortcuts** button, which resets all the shortcuts to how they appeared when CommandPost was first installed, and a **Set All Shortcuts to None**, which sets all shortcuts to None.
