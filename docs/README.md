# CommandPost

**Workflow Toolkit for Post Production Professionals**

CommandPost is a **free** and [open source](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost/blob/develop/LICENSE.md){target="_blank"} macOS application that bridges between control surfaces and software that doesn’t support them natively, such as Apple’s [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/){target="_blank"} and Adobe’s [After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html){target="_blank"}.

It’s been downloaded over [168 thousand times](https://hanadigital.github.io/grev/?user=commandpost&repo=commandpost){target="_blank"}, and there are over [2.6 thousands members](https://www.facebook.com/groups/commandpost/members){target="_blank"} in our [Facebook Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/commandpost/){target="_blank"}.

It's been used for projects for **Netflix**, **Pixar** and the **BBC**. Even Apple employees also use it for lots of things!

### Built for Professionals

> Chris, you have no idea how helpful your Titles to Keywords toolbox has been on our latest production. Without the toolbox these 2-3 hour long timelines (around 900 keywords) would have been nearly impossible to tag with the FCP built in way. It's very long scenes with around 50 lines of text for all characters.<br />
> _[Sam Pluemacher](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10223233/){target="_blank"} (assistant editor on Netflix's Blood Red Sky)_

**Blood & Gold** was cut on Final Cut Pro and made extensive use of CommandPost's [Titles to Keywords Toolbox](https://commandpost.io/toolbox/titles-to-keywords/).

### Where Technology Meets Creativity

> CommandPost and FCP are so intertwined on my day to day that I see them as one app.<br />
> _[Marcos Castiel BFE](http://www.marcoscastiel.com/){target="_blank"}_

CommandPost has been **built by filmmakers, for filmmakers**.

However, it's also used by developers, scientists and macOS power users all over the world to seriously speed up mundane tasks through powerful and customisable automation tools.

### Experience Unparalleled Control

> As someone who doesn’t like clicking to do things, CommandPost makes my work much more likeable.
> _[Oli Frost](https://olifro.st/){target="_blank"}_

CommandPost has deep support for a wide range of control surfaces.

It even brings back **Razer** keypad support to the Mac!

You can basically control ANYTHING in Final Cut Pro with a huge range of control surfaces.

### Revolutionise Your Workflow

CommandPost allows you to do things in Final Cut Pro that are otherwise not possible, such as **Highlight Browser Playhead** and **Scrolling Timeline**.

### Say Goodbye to Complexity

CommandPost can do complex things with a single keystroke, such as exporting your Final Cut Pro Timeline Index and Browser Contents to a CSV!

### Powerful Search Console Redefines Navigation

CommandPost has an insanely powerful Search Console that allows you to trigger all of CommandPost's actions.

This is accessible from every application, as is used to assign actions to control surfaces.

### Diversify Your Creativity

Whilst CommandPost was originally designed with Final Cut Pro in mind, it can control ANY Mac application.

It's also always growing and expanding, for example it can scan After Effects so that you can trigger any effect from a control surface!

### Powered by Lua

Powered by [Lua](https://dev.commandpost.io/lua/overview/){target="_blank"} (the same scripting language used by [Blackmagic Fusion](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/fusion/){target="_blank"}, [Adobe Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/au/products/photoshop-lightroom.html){target="_blank"} and even parts of [Apple iOS](https://twitter.com/_inside/status/1026173832527265792){target="_blank"}), it's insanely customisable and powerful.

It runs natively on Apple Silicon and is fully compatible with [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org){target="_blank"}.
