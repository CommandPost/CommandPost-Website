CommandPost was created by [Chris Hocking](https://github.com/latenitefilms) as a proof-of-concept to make finding the Final Cut Pro browser playhead easier for [Scott Simmons](http://www.scottsimmons.tv/).

You can read the origin story [here](https://latenitefilms.com/blog/final-cut-pro-hacks/).

It’s now developed, maintained and supported by [Chris Hocking](https://github.com/latenitefilms) & [David Peterson](https://github.com/randomeizer) through [GitHub](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost).

CommandPost’s icon was designed by the amazing [Matthew Skiles](https://matthewskiles.com).
