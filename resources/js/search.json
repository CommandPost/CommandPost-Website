basically just need to toggle a boolean hidden within a preference file inside the Final Cut Pro Library.","In the early days of FCPX Hacks we added an option for Moveable Markers which enables them using the same technique Alex found, except it allowed users to easily toggle the feature on and off using the menu bar or shortcut keys.","When we transitioned FCPX Hacks to CommandPost, we kept this feature, however we've since decided that it's probably a bad idea to modify the contents of the Final Cut Pro application bundle, so we removed this feature all together, along with other features that modify the contents of the Final Cut Pro application bundle (such as inserting our commands into the Final Cut Pro Command Editor).","We want CommandPost to be as safe and reliable as possible, and we want to avoid using \"hacks\" to make things happen.","The easiest way to enable Moveable Markers is via Terminal.","This works on Final Cut Pro 10.5.2 and below on both Intel and Apple

We all know what “Picture Lock” is.","Picture lock is a stage in editing a film or editing a television production. It is the stage prior to online editing when all changes to the film or television program cut have been done and approved. It is then sent to subsequent stages in the process, such as online editing and audio mixing. Any last-minute changes can force portions of subsequent work to be redone.","Source: Wikipedia","In an analogous fashion, Sound Lock is a stage in a film or editing a television production where a sequence is edited before the production starts principal photography. In other words, before the project is being shot, in the pre-production or development stage. You could call it “Pre-Editing” as well. The filmmaker would use a series of concept images to construct a timeline."]},{"i":"what-is-sound-locking","l":"What is Sound Locking?","p":["Now, you might ask, where does the Sound component come in? In projects like Music Video, music follows higher precedence over visuals. Not that the visuals are not important, but in 99% of all Music Videos, the music will always be composed and recorded first. Thus, with that piece of the Music, it becomes the “Locked” component. It will never change. The filmmaker now uses that music track as an anchor point to construct the matching visual or rather envisioned visuals against that music right within the NLE. These envisioned visuals could come as a set of reference images, hand-drawn sketches or even 3D generated shots. It mostly revolves around the filmmaker’s workflow.","Sound Locking is not an entirely a new concept. Filmmakers, Music Video Directors and the animation industry have utilised this technique for a long time. The biggest hurdle from the above mentioned workflow is, there is no path to bring shot and scene information out from NLE to on-set usage meaningfully. Even if you have edited and prepared the sequence, the only method within the NLE is to export that sequence out as a rendered video file. It is not entirely useful, and shot information is not entirely homogenous. You are also required to do a Shot List manually based on the envisioned visuals. Which would precipitate tons of physical print out for various departments in productions, which yields a non eco-friendly work practice.","However, there are applications on the market like Shot Lister, Studio Binder or Celtx that allow you to develop industry standard Shot Lists. But all seems to tackle the Shot List construction from a script level. There is undoubtedly nothing wrong with this approach. The script is the anchor point, as screenplay is the foundation of every production.","For Music Videos and music driven narratives, sound or music invariably takes higher precedence. You can’t visualise music on a sheet of paper except on a musical score sheet and you can’t conceivably construct a Shot List from a score sheet."]},{"l":"The Most Resilient Parasite","p":["What is the most resilient parasite?

This table will be passed into the get and set functions for the property if present. This is mostly useful if your property depends on internal instance values of a table. For example, you might want to make a property work as a method instead of a function:","To use a prop as a method, you need to attach it to the owning table, like so:","You can also use the prop.bind function to bind multple properties at once:","The prop.extend function will also bind any cp.prop values it finds:","The bound owner is passed in as the last parameter of the get and set functions."]},{"l":"8.

It is 1/705600000 of a second, exactly.","1 flick = 1/705600000 second","This unit of time is the smallest time unit which is LARGER than a nanosecond, and can in integer quantities exactly represent a single frame duration for 24 Hz, 25 Hz, 30 Hz, 48 Hz, 50 Hz, 60 Hz, 90 Hz, 100 Hz, 120 Hz, and also 1/1000 divisions of each, as well as a single sample duration for 8 kHz, 16 kHz, 22.05 kHz, 24 kHz, 32 kHz, 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz, 88.2 kHz, 96 kHz, and 192kHz, as well as the NTSC frame durations for 24 * (1000/1001) Hz, 30 * (1000/1001) Hz, 60 * (1000/1001) Hz, and 120 * (1000/1001) Hz.","That above was one hell of a run-on sentence, but it's strictly and completely correct in its description of the unit.","This makes flicks suitable for use via std::chrono::duration and std::ratio for doing timing work against the system high resolution clock, which is in nanoseconds, but doesn't get slightly out of sync when doing common frame rates.","We also support some common audio sample rates as well. This list is not exhaustive, but covers the majority of digital audio formats. They are 8kHz, 16kHz, 22.05kHz, 24kHz, 32kHz, 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz, 96kHz, and 192kHz.","Though it is not part of the design criteria, 144 Hz, which some newer monitors refresh at, does work correctly with flicks.","NTSC IS NOT EXPLICITLY SUPPORTED IN ALL OF ITS SUBTLE NUANCES, BUT: The NTSC variations (~ 23.976, ~ 29.97, etc) are approximately defined as 24 * 1000/1001 and 30 * 1000/1001, etc. These can be represented exactly in flicks, but 1/1000 divisions are not available.","Many folks online have pointed out that NTSC technically has a variable frame rate, and that this is handled correctly in other media playback libraries such as QuickTime. The goal of flicks is to provide a simple, convenient std::chrono::duration to work with when writing code that works with simulation and time in media, but not explicitly to handle complex variable-rate playback scenarios. So we'll stick with the 1000/1001 approximations, and leave it at that!"]},{"l":"Details","p":["100 fps frame: 7056000 flicks","120 fps frame: 5880000 flicks","16000 fps frame: 44100 flicks","192000 fps frame: 3675 flicks","22050 fps frame: 32000 flicks","24 fps frame: 29400000 flicks","24000 fps frame: 29400 flicks","25 fps frame: 28224000 flicks","30 fps frame: 23520000 flicks","32000 fps frame: 22050 flicks","44100 fps frame: 16000 flicks","48 fps frame: 14700000 flicks","48000 fps frame: 14700 flicks","50 fps frame: 14112000 flicks","60 fps frame: 11760000 flicks","8000 fps frame: 88200 flicks","88200 fps frame: 8000 flicks","90 fps frame: 7840000 flicks","96000 fps frame: 7350 flicks"]},{"i":"ntsc","l":"NTSC:","p":["24 * 1000/1001 (~ 23.976) fps frame: 29429400 flicks","30 * 1000/1001 (~ 29.97) fps frame: 23543520 flicks","60 * 1000/1001 (~ 59.94) fps frame: 11771760 flicks","120 * 1000/1001 (~ 119.88) fps frame: 5885880 flicks"]},{"l":"API Overview","p":["Constants - Useful values which cannot be changed","Constructors - API calls which return an object, typically one that offers API methods","Functions - API calls offered directly by the extension","is","Methods - API calls which can only be made on an object returned by a constructor","new","parse","perFrame100","perFrame120","perFrame120NTSC","perFrame24","perFrame24NTSC","perFrame25","perFrame30","perFrame30NTSC","perFrame44100","perFrame48","perFrame48000","perFrame50","perFrame60","perFrame60NTSC","perFrame90","perHour","perMinutes","perSecond","toFrames","toSeconds","toTimecode"]},{"l":"API Documentation"},{"l":"Constants","p":["An approximate for flicks in 1 frame at 120 fps in NTSC, a.k.a. ~ 119.88 fps.","An approximate for flicks in 1 frame at 24 fps in NTSC, a.k.a. 23.976 fps.","An approximate for flicks in 1 frame at 30 fps in NTSC, a.k.a. 29.97 fps.","An approximate for flicks in 1 frame at 60 fps in NTSC, a.k.a. 59.94 fps.","Constant","cp.time.flicks.perFrame100","cp.time.flicks.perFrame120","cp.time.flicks.perFrame120NTSC","cp.time.flicks.perFrame24","cp.time.flicks.perFrame24NTSC","cp.time.flicks.perFrame25","cp.time.flicks.perFrame30","cp.time.flicks.perFrame30NTSC","cp.time.flicks.perFrame44100","cp.time.flicks.perFrame48","cp.time.flicks.perFrame48000","cp.time.flicks.perFrame50","cp.time.flicks.perFrame60","cp.time.flicks.perFrame60NTSC","cp.time.flicks.perFrame90","cp.time.flicks.perHour","cp.time.flicks.perMinutes","cp.time.flicks.perSecond","Description","perFrame100","perFrame120","perFrame120NTSC","perFrame24","perFrame24NTSC","perFrame25","perFrame30","perFrame30NTSC","perFrame44100","perFrame48","perFrame48000","perFrame50","perFrame60","perFrame60NTSC","perFrame90","perHour","perMinutes","perSecond","Signature","The number of flicks in 1 frame at 100 fps.","The number of flicks in 1 frame at 120 fps.","The number of flicks in 1 frame at 24 fps.","The number of flicks in 1 frame at 25 fps.","The number of flicks in 1 frame at 30 fps.","The number of flicks in 1 frame at 44100 fps, a.k.a. 44.1 Hz.","The number of flicks in 1 frame at 44100 fps, a.k.a. 48 Hz.","The number of flicks in 1 frame at 48 fps.","The number of flicks in 1 frame at 50 fps.","The number of flicks in 1 frame at 60 fps.","The number of flicks in 1 frame at 90 fps.","The number of flicks in 1 hour.","The number of flicks in 1 minute.","The number of flicks in 1 second.","Type"]},{"l":"Functions","p":["is","Signature","cp.time.flicks.is(thing) - boolean","Type","Function","Description","Checks if the thing is a flicks instance.","Parameters","thing - the thing to check","Returns","true if the thingis a flicks instance, otherwise false.","Notes"]},{"l":"Constructors","p":["| new | | | --------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Signature | cp.time.flicks.new(value) - flicks | | Type | Constructor | | Description | Creates a new flicks instance.

Please refer to hs.axuielement:elementSearch for details about the returned object and callback arguments.","| elementSearch | | | --------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Signature | hs.axuielement:elementSearch(callback, [criteria], [namedModifiers]) - elementSearchObject | | Type | Method | | Description | Search for and generate a table of the accessibility elements for the attributes and descendants of this object based on the specified criteria. | | Parameters | callback - a (usually) required function which will receive the results of this search. The callback should expect three arguments and return none. The arguments to the callback function will be msg, a string specifying how the search ended and results, the elementSearchObject containing the requested results, and the number of items added to the results (see count in namedModifiers). msg will be \"completed\" if the search completes normally, or a string starting with \"\" if it is terminated early (see Returns: and Notes: for more details).criteria - an optional function which should accept one argument (the current element being examined) and return true if it should be included in the results or false if it should be rejected. See hs.axuielement.searchCriteriaFunction to create a search function that uses hs.axuielement:matchesCriteria for evaluation.namedModifiers - an optional table specifying key-value pairs that further modify or control the search. This table may contain 0 or more of the following keys: count - an optional integer, default math.huge, specifying the maximum number of matches to collect before ending the search and invoking the callback. You can continue the search to find additional elements by invoking elementSearchObject:next() (described below in the Returns section) on the return value of this method, or on the results argument passed to the callback. depth - an optional integer, default math.huge, specifying the maximum number of steps (descendants) from the initial accessibility element the search should visit. If you know that your desired element(s) are relatively close to your starting element, setting this to a lower value can significantly speed up the search. The following are also recognized, but may impact the speed of the search, the responsiveness of Hammerspoon, or the format of the results in ways that limit further filtering and are not recommended except when you know that you require them:asTree - an optional boolean, default false, and ignored if criteria is specified and non-empty, objectOnly is true, or count is specified. This modifier specifies whether the search results should return as an array table of tables containing each element's details (false) or as a tree where in which the root node details are the key-value pairs of the returned table and descendant elements are likewise described in subtables attached to the attribute name they belong to (true). This format is primarily for debugging and exploratory purposes and may not be arranged for easy programatic evaluation.includeParents - a boolean, default false, specifying whether or not parent attributes (AXParent and AXTopLevelUIElement) should be examined during the search. Note that in most cases, setting this value to true will end up traversing the entire Accessibility structure for the target application and may significantly slow down the search.noCallback - an optional boolean, default false, and ignored if callback is not also nil, allowing you to specify nil as the callback when set to true. This feature requires setting this named argument to true and specifying the callback field as nil because starting a query from an element with a lot of descendants WILL block Hammerspoon and slow down the responsiveness of your computer (I've seen blocking for over 5 minutes in extreme cases) and should be used only when you know you are starting from close to the end of the element hierarchy.objectOnly - an optional boolean, default true, specifying whether each result in the final table will be the accessibility element discovered (true) or a table containing details about the element include the attribute names, actions, etc. for the element (false). This latter format is primarily for debugging and exploratory purposes and may not be arranged for easy programatic evaluation. | | Returns | an elementSearchObject which contains metamethods allowing you to check to see if the process has completed and cancel it early if desired. The methods include: elementSearchObject:cancel([reason]) - cancels the current search and invokes the callback with the partial results already collected. If you specify reason, the msg argument for the callback will be ** reason; otherwise it will be \" cancelled\". elementSearchObject:isRunning() - returns true if the search is currently ongoing or false if it has completed or been cancelled. elementSearchObject:matched() - returns an integer specifying the number of elements which have already been found that meet the specified criteria function. elementSearchObject:runTime() - returns an integer specifying the number of seconds spent performing this search. Note that this is not an accurate measure of how much time a given search will always take because the time will be greatly affected by how much other activity is occurring within Hammerspoon and on the users computer. Resuming a cancelled search or a search which invoked the callback because it reached count items with the next method (described below) will cause this number to begin increasing again to provide a cumulative total of time spent performing the search; time between when the callback is invoked and the next method is invoked is not included. elementSearchObject:visited() - returns an integer specifying the number of elements which have been examined during the search so far. If asTree is false or not specified, the following additional methods will be available: elementSearchObject:filter(criteria, [callback]) - filterObject returns a new table containing elements in the search results that match the specified criteria. criteria - a required function which should accept one argument (the current element being examined) and return true if it should be included in the results or false if it should be rejected. See hs.axuielement.searchCriteriaFunction to create a search function that uses hs.axuielement:matchesCriteria for evaluation. callback - an optional callback which should expect two arguments and return none. If a callback is specified, the callback will receive two arguments, a msg indicating how the callback ended (the message format matches the style defined for this method) and the filterObject which contains the matching elements. The filterObject returned by this method and passed to the callback, if defined, will support the following methods as defined here: cancel, filter, isRunning, matched, runTime, and visited. elementSearchObject:next() - if the search was cancelled or reached the count of matches specified, this method will continue the search where it left off. The elementSearchObject returned when the callback is next invoked will have up to count items added to the existing results (calls to next are cumulative for the total results captured in the elementSearchObject). The third argument to the callback will be the number of items added to the search results, not the number of items in the search results. | | Notes | This method utilizes coroutines to keep Hammerspoon responsive, but may be slow to complete if includeParents is true, if you do not specify depth, or if you start from an element that has a lot of descendants (e.g. the application element for a web browser). This is dependent entirely upon how many active accessibility elements the target application defines and where you begin your search and cannot reliably be determined up front, so you may need to experiment to find the best balance for your specific requirements.The search performed is a breadth-first search, so in general earlier elements in the results table will be \"closer\" in the Accessibility hierarchy to the starting point than later elements.The elementSearchObject returned by this method and the results passed in as the second argument to the callback function are the same object -- you can use either one in your code depending upon which makes the most sense. Results that match the criteria function are added to the elementSearchObject as they are found, so if you examine the object/table returned by this method and determine that you have located the element or elements you require before the callback has been invoked, you can safely invoke the cancel method to end the search early. The exception to this is when asTree is true and objectsOnly is false and the search criteria is nil -- see hs.axuielement:buildTree. In this case, the results passed to the callback will be equal to elementSearchObject[1].If objectsOnly is specified as false, it may take some time after cancel is invoked for the mapping of element attribute tables to the descendant elements in the results set -- this is a by product of the need to iterate through the results to match up all of the instances of each element to it's attribute table.hs.axuielement:allDescendantElements is syntactic sugar for hs.axuielement:elementSearch(callback, { [includeParents = withParents] })hs.axuielement:buildTree is syntactic sugar for hs.axuielement:elementSearch(callback, { objectOnly = false, asTree = true, [depth = depth], [includeParents = withParents] }) |","a boolean value indicating whether or not the accessibility object is still valid or nil and an error string if any other accessibility error occurred","a boolean value indicating whether or not the value of the parameter can be modified or nil and an error string if an accessibility error occurred","a new userdata object representing a new reference to the Accessibility object.","a string containing a description of the object's action, nil if no description is available, or nil and an error string if an accessibility error occurred","a table containing this object and 0 or more parent objects representing the path from the root object to this element.","a table containing zero or more axuielementObjects.","a table with key-value pairs corresponding to the attributes of the accessibility object or nil and an error string if an accessibility error occurred","action- the name of the action, as specified by hs.axuielement:actionNames.","actionDescription","actionNames","allAttributeValues","allDescendantElements","an accessibilityObject can become invalid for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to the element referred to no longer being available (e.g. an element referring to a window or one of its descendants that has been closed) or the application terminating.","an array of the names of all actions supported by the axuielementObject or nil and an error string if an accessibility error occurred","an array of the names of all attributes supported by the axuielementObject or nil and an error string if an accessibility error occurred","an array of the names of all parameterized attributes supported by the axuielementObject or nil and an error string if an accessibility error occurred","an axuielementObject for the object at the specified coordinates, or nil and an error string if no object could be identified or an accessibility error occurred","An element is considered a window by this method if it has an AXRole of AXWindow.","An element is considered an application by this method if it has an AXRole of AXApplication and has a process identifier (pid).","an elementSearchObject as described in hs.axuielement:elementSearch","asHSApplication","asHSWindow","attribute- the name of the attribute, as specified by hs.axuielement:attributeNames.","attribute- the name of the attribute, as specified by hs.axuielement:attributeNames. value- the value to assign to the attribute","attribute- the name of the attribute, as specified by hs.axuielement:parameterizedAttributeNames. parameter- the parameter required by the parameterized attribute.","attributeNames","attributeValue","attributeValueCount","buildTree","callback- a required function which should expect two arguments: a msg string specifying how the search ended, and a table containing the discovered descendant elements. msg will be \"completed\" when the traversal has completed normally and will contain a string starting with \"**\" if it terminates early for some reason (see Notes: section for more information) withParents- an optional boolean, default false, indicating that the parent of objects (and their descendants) should be collected as well.","callback- a required function which should expect two arguments: a msg string specifying how the search ended, and a table containing the recorded information. msg will be \"completed\" when the search has completed normally (or reached the specified depth) and will contain a string starting with \"**\" if it terminates early for some reason (see Notes: section for more information) depth- an optional integer, default math.huge, specifying the maximum depth from the initial accessibility object that should be visited to identify descendant elements and their attributes. withParents- an optional boolean, default false, specifying whether or not an element's (or descendant's) attributes for AXParent and AXTopLevelUIElement should also be visited when identifying additional elements to include in the results table.","Captures all of the available information for the accessibility object and its descendants and returns it in a table for inspection.","childrenWithRole","Common action names can be found in the hs.axuielement.actions table;

The table should be defined as follows: one or more of the following must be specified (though all specified must match): attribute-- a string, or table of strings, specifying attributes that the element must support. action-- a string, or table of strings, specifying actions that the element must be able to perform. parameterizedAttribute-- a string, or table of strings, specifying parametrized attributes that the element must support. if the attribute key is specified, you can use one of the following to specify a specific value the attribute must equal for a positive match. No more than one of these should be provided. If neither are present, then only the existence of the attributes specified by attribute are required. value-- a value, or table of values, that a specified attribute must equal. If it's a table, then only one of the values has to match the attribute value for a positive match. Note that if you specify more than one attribute with the attribute key, you must provide at least one value for each attribute in this table (order does not matter, but the match will fail if any attribute does not match at least one value provided). when specifying a value which is itself a table with keys (e.g. frame, size, url, color, etc.) then you must provide the value or values as a table of tables, e.g. { { y = 22 } }. only those keys which are specified within the value are checked for equality (or pattern matching). Values which are present in the attribute's value but are not specified in the comparison value are ignored (i.e. the previous example of y = 22 would only check the y component of an AXFrame attribute -- the x, h, and w values would be ignored). For value components which are numeric, e.g. 22 in the previous example, the default comparison is equality. You may change this with the comparison key described below in the optional keys. For possible keys when trying to match a color, see the documentation for hs.drawing.color. For possible keys when trying to match a URL, use url = string and/or filePath = string. The string for the specified table key will be compared in accordance with the pattern optional key described below. when specifying a value which is itself a table of values (e.g. a list of axuielementObjects) you must provide the value or values as a table of tables, e.g. { { obj1, obj2 } }. Order of the elements provided in the comparison value does not matter -- this only tests for existence within the attributes value. The test is for inclusion only -- the attribute's value may contain other elements as well, but must contain those specified within the comparison value. nilValue-- a boolean, specifying that the attributes must not have an assigned value (true) or may be assigned any value except nil (false). If the value key is specified, this key is ignored. Note that this applies to all of the attributes specified with the attribute key. the following are optional keys and are not required: pattern-- a boolean, default false, specifying whether string matches for attribute values should be evaluated with string.match(true) or as exact matches (false). See the Lua manual, section 6.4.1 ( help.lua._man._6_4_1 in the Hammerspoon console). If the value key is not set, than this key is ignored. invert-- a boolean, default false, specifying inverted logic for the criteria result --- if this is true and the criteria matches, evaluate criteria as false; otherwise evaluate as true. comparison-- a string, default \"\", specifying the comparison to be used when comparing numeric values. Possible comparison strings are: \"\" for equality, \"<\" for less than, \"<=\" for less than or equal to, \">\" for greater than, \">=\" for greater than or equal to, or \"~=\" for not equal to. an array table of one or more key-value tables as described immediately above; the element must be a positive match for all of the individual criteria tables specified (logical AND).

See hs.bonjour:findServices for more details if you need to create your own query which can persist for longer periods of time or require termination logic that ignores the macOS's best guess.","this function may not work for all clients implementing multicast DNS; it has been successfully tested with macOS and Linux targets running the Avahi Daemon service, but has generally returned an error when used with minimalist implementations found in common IOT devices and embedded electronics.","Type"]},{"l":"Constructors","p":["new","Signature","hs.bonjour.new() - browserObject","Type","Constructor","Description","Creates a new network service browser that finds published services on a network using multicast DNS.","Parameters","None","Returns","a new browserObject or nil if an error occurs","Notes"]},{"l":"Methods","p":["| findBrowsableDomains | | | --------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Signature | hs.bonjour:findBrowsableDomains(callback) - browserObject | | Type | Method | | Description | Return a list of zero-conf and bonjour domains visible to the users computer. | | Parameters | callback - a function which will be invoked as visible domains are discovered.

This is a best guess and may not always be accurate if your network is slow or some servers on your network are particularly slow to respond.In addition, if you leave the browser running this method, you will get future updates when services are removed because of server shutdowns or added because of new servers being booted up.Leaving the browser running does consume some system resources though, so you will have to determine, based upon your specific requirements, if this is a concern for your specific task or not. To terminate the browser when you have retrieved all of the information you require, you can use the hs.bonjour:stop method.The special type \"_services._dns-sd._udp.\" can be used to discover the types of services being advertised on your network. The hs.bonjour.service objects returned to the callback function cannot actually be resolved, but you can use the hs.bonjour.service:name method to create a list of services that are currently present and being advertised. this special type is used by the shortcut function hs.bonjour.networkServices for this specific purpose.The special domain \"dns-sd.org.\" can be specified to find services advertised through Wide-Area Service Discovery as described at http://www.dns-sd.org. This can be used to discover a limited number of globally available sites on the internet, especially with a service type of _http._tcp.. In theory, with additional software, you may be able to publish services on your machine for Wide-Area Service discovery using this domain with hs.bonjour.service.new but the local dns server requirements and security implications of doing so are beyond the scope of this documentation.

This attribute has no default and must be specified for each element in the canvas array. Valid type strings are: arc- an arc inscribed on a circle, defined by radius, center, startAngle, and endAngle. canvas- an independent canvas object, displayed as an element within the specified frame. Defined by canvas and frame. circle- a circle, defined by radius and center. ellipticalArc- an arc inscribed on an oval, defined by frame, startAngle, and endAngle. image- an image as defined by one of the hs.image constructors. oval- an oval, defined by frame points- a list of points defined in coordinates. rectangle- a rectangle, optionally with rounded corners, defined by frame. resetClip- a special type -- indicates that the current clipping shape should be reset to the canvas default (the full canvas area). See Clipping Example. All other attributes, except action are ignored. segments- a list of line segments or bezier curves with control points, defined in coordinates. text- a string or hs.styledtext object, defined by text and frame.* The following is a list of all valid attributes. Not all attributes apply to every type, but you can set them for any type. action- Default strokeAndFill. A string specifying the action to take for the element in the array. The following actions are recognized: clip- append the shape to the current clipping region for the canvas. Ignored for canvas, image, and text types. build- do not render the element -- its shape is preserved and the next element in the canvas array is appended to it. This can be used to create complex shapes or clipping regions. The stroke and fill settings for a complex object created in this manner will be those of the final object of the group. Ignored for canvas, image, and text types. fill- fill the canvas element, if it is a shape, or display it normally if it is a canvas, image or text. Ignored for resetClip. skip- ignore this element or its effects. Can be used to temporarily \"remove\" an object from the canvas. stroke- stroke (outline) the canvas element, if it is a shape, or display it normally if it is a canvas, image or text. Ignored for resetClip. strokeAndFill- stroke and fill the canvas element, if it is a shape, or display it normally if it is a canvas, image or text. Ignored for resetClip. absolutePosition- Default true. If false, numeric location and size attributes ( frame, center, radius, and coordinates) will be automatically adjusted when the canvas is resized with hs.canvas:size or hs.canvas:frame so that the element remains in the same relative position in the canvas. absoluteSize- Default true. If false, numeric location and size attributes ( frame, center, radius, and coordinates) will be automatically adjusted when the canvas is resized with hs.canvas:size or hs.canvas:frame so that the element maintains the same relative size in the canvas. antialias- Default true. Indicates whether or not antialiasing should be enabled for the element. arcRadii- Default true. Used by the arc and ellipticalArc types to specify whether or not line segments from the element's center to the start and end angles should be included in the element's visible portion. This affects whether the object's stroke is a pie-shape or an arc with a chord from the start angle to the end angle. arcClockwise- Default true. Used by the arc and ellipticalArc types to specify whether the arc should be drawn from the start angle to the end angle in a clockwise (true) direction or in a counter-clockwise (false) direction. canvas- Defaults to nil. A separate canvas object which is to be displayed as an element in this canvas. The object must not currently belong to a visible window. Assign nil to this property to release a previously assigned object for use elsewhere as an element or on its own. canvasAlpha- Default 1.0. Specifies the alpha value to apply to the independent canvas element. compositeRule- A string, default \"sourceOver\", specifying how this element should be combined with earlier elements of the canvas. See hs.canvas.compositeTypes for a list of valid strings and their descriptions. center- Default { x = 50%, y = 50% }. Used by the circle and arc types to specify the center of the canvas element. The x and y fields can be specified as numbers or as a string. When specified as a string, the value is treated as a percentage of the canvas size. See the section on percentages for more information. clipToPath- Default false. Specifies whether the clipping regions should be temporarily limited to the element's shape while rendering this element or not. This can be used to produce crisper edges, as seen with hs.drawing but reduces stroke width granularity for widths less than 1.0 and causes occasional \"missing\" lines with the segments element type. Ignored for the canvas, image, point, and text types. closed- Default false. Used by the segments type to specify whether or not the shape defined by the lines and curves defined should be closed (true) or open (false). When an object is closed, an implicit line is stroked from the final point back to the initial point of the coordinates listed. coordinates- An array containing coordinates used by the segments and points types to define the lines and curves or points that make up the canvas element. The following keys are recognized and may be specified as numbers or strings (see the section on percentages). x- required for segments and points, specifying the x coordinate of a point. y- required for segments and points, specifying the y coordinate of a point. c1x- optional for segments, specifying the x coordinate of the first control point used to draw a bezier curve between this point and the previous point. Ignored for points and if present in the first coordinate in the coordinates array./lili c1y- optional for segments, specifying the y coordinate of the first control point used to draw a bezier curve between this point and the previous point. Ignored for points and if present in the first coordinate in the coordinates array. c2x- optional for segments, specifying the x coordinate of the second control point used to draw a bezier curve between this point and the previous point. Ignored for points and if present in the first coordinate in the coordinates array./lili c2y- optional for segments, specifying the y coordinate of the second control point used to draw a bezier curve between this point and the previous point. Ignored for points and if present in the first coordinate in the coordinates array. endAngle- Default 360.0. Used by the arc and ellipticalArc to specify the ending angle position for the inscribed arc. fillColor- Default { red = 1.0 }. Specifies the color used to fill the canvas element when the action is set to fill or strokeAndFill and fillGradient is equal to none. Ignored for the canvas, image, points, and text types. fillGradient- Default \"none\". A string specifying whether a fill gradient should be used instead of the fill color when the action is fill or strokeAndFill. May be \"none\", \"linear\", or \"radial\". fillGradientAngle- Default 0.0. Specifies the direction of a linear gradient when fillGradient is linear. fillGradientCenter- Default { x = 0.0, y = 0.0 }. Specifies the relative center point within the elements bounds of a radial gradient when fillGradient is radial. The x and y fields must both be between -1.0 and 1.0 inclusive. fillGradientColors- Default { { white = 0.0 }, { white = 1.0 } }. Specifies the colors to use for the gradient when fillGradient is not none. You must specify at least two colors, each of which must be convertible into the RGB color space (i.e. they cannot be an image being used as a color pattern). The gradient will blend from the first to the next, and so on until the last color. If more than two colors are specified, the \"color stops\" will be placed at evenly spaced intervals within the element. flatness- Default 0.6. A number which specifies the accuracy (or smoothness) with which curves are rendered. It is also the maximum error tolerance (measured in pixels) for rendering curves, where smaller numbers give smoother curves at the expense of more computation. flattenPath- Default false. Specifies whether curved line segments should be converted into straight line approximations. The granularity of the approximations is controlled by the path's current flatness value. frame- Default { x = 0%, y = 0%, h = 100%, w = 100% }. Used by the rectangle, oval, ellipticalArc, text, canvas and image types to specify the element's position and size. When the key value for x, y, h, or w are specified as a string, the value is treated as a percentage of the canvas size. See the section on percentages for more information. id- An optional string or number which is included in mouse callbacks to identify the element which was the target of the mouse event. If this is not specified for an element, it's index position is used instead. image- Defaults to a blank image. Used by the image type to specify an hs.image object to display as an image. imageAlpha- Defaults to 1.0. A number between 0.0 and 1.0 specifying the alpha value to be applied to the image specified by image. Note that if an image is a template image, then this attribute will internally default to 0.5 unless explicitly set for the element. imageAlignment- Default \"center\". A string specifying the alignment of the image within the canvas element's frame. Valid values for this attribute are \"center\", \"bottom\", \"topLeft\", \"bottomLeft\", \"bottomRight\", \"left\", \"right\", \"top\", and \"topRight\". imageAnimationFrame- Default 0. An integer specifying the image frame to display when the image is from an animated GIF. This attribute is ignored for other image types. May be specified as a negative integer indicating that the image frame should be calculated from the last frame and calculated backwards (i.e. specifying -1 selects the last frame for the GIF.) imageAnimates- Default false. A boolean specifying whether or not an animated GIF should be animated or if only a single frame should be shown. Ignored for other image types. imageScaling- Default \"scaleProportionally\". A string specifying how the image should be scaled within the canvas element's frame. Valid values for this attribute are: scaleToFit- shrink the image, preserving the aspect ratio, to fit the drawing frame only if the image is larger than the drawing frame. shrinkToFit- shrink or expand the image to fully fill the drawing frame. This does not preserve the aspect ratio. none- perform no scaling or resizing of the image. scaleProportionally- shrink or expand the image to fully fill the drawing frame, preserving the aspect ration. miterLimit- Default 10.0. The limit at which miter joins are converted to bevel join when strokeJoinStyle is miter. The miter limit helps you avoid spikes at the junction of two line segments. When the ratio of the miter length—the diagonal length of the miter join—to the line thickness exceeds the miter limit, the joint is converted to a bevel join. Ignored for the canvas, text, and image types. padding- Default 0.0. When an element specifies position information by percentage (i.e. as a string), the actual frame used for calculating position values is inset from the canvas frame on all sides by this amount. If you are using shadows with your elements, the shadow position is not included in the element's size and position specification; this attribute can be used to provide extra space for the shadow to be fully rendered within the canvas. radius- Default \"50%\". Used by the arc and circle types to specify the radius of the circle for the element. May be specified as a string or a number. When specified as a string, the value is treated as a percentage of the canvas size. See the section on percentages for more information. reversePath- Default false. Specifies drawing direction for the canvas element. By default, canvas elements are drawn from the point nearest the origin (top left corner) in a clockwise direction. Setting this to true causes the element to be drawn in a counter-clockwise direction. This will mostly affect fill and stroke dash patterns, but can also be used with clipping regions to create cut-outs. Ignored for canvas, image, and text types. roundedRectRadii- Default { xRadius = 0.0, yRadius = 0.0 }. shadow- Default { blurRadius = 5.0, color = { alpha = 1/3 }, offset = { h = -5.0, w = 5.0 } }. Specifies the shadow blurring, color, and offset to be added to an element which has withShadow set to true. startAngle- Default 0.0. Used by the arc and ellipticalArc to specify the starting angle position for the inscribed arc. strokeCapStyle- Default \"butt\". A string which specifies the shape of the endpoints of an open path when stroked. Primarily noticeable for lines rendered with the segments type. Valid values for this attribute are \"butt\", \"round\", and \"square\". strokeColor- Default { white = 0 }. Specifies the stroke (outline) color for a canvas element when the action is set to stroke or strokeAndFill. Ignored for the canvas, text, and image types. strokeDashPattern- Default {}. Specifies an array of numbers specifying a dash pattern for stroked lines when an element's action attribute is set to stroke or strokeAndFill. The numbers in the array alternate with the first element specifying a dash length in points, the second specifying a gap length in points, the third a dash length, etc. The array repeats to fully stroke the element. Ignored for the canvas, image, and text types. strokeDashPhase- Default 0.0. Specifies an offset, in points, where the dash pattern specified by strokeDashPattern should start. Ignored for the canvas, image, and text types. strokeJoinStyle- Default \"miter\". A string which specifies the shape of the joints between connected segments of a stroked path. Valid values for this attribute are \"miter\", \"round\", and \"bevel\". Ignored for element types of canvas, image, and text. strokeWidth- Default 1.0. Specifies the width of stroked lines when an element's action is set to stroke or strokeAndFill. Ignored for the canvas, image, and text element types. text- Default . Specifies the text to display for a text element. This may be specified as a string, or as an hs.styledtext object. textAlignment- Default natural. A string specifying the alignment of the text within a canvas element of type text. This field is ignored if the text is specified as an hs.styledtext object. Valid values for this attributes are: left- the text is visually left aligned. right- the text is visually right aligned. center- the text is visually center aligned. justified- the text is justified natural- the natural alignment of the text’s script textColor- Default { white = 1.0 }. Specifies the color to use when displaying the text element type, if the text is specified as a string. This field is ignored if the text is specified as an hs.styledtext object. textFont- Defaults to the default system font. A string specifying the name of the font to use when displaying the text element type, if the text is specified as a string. This field is ignored if the text is specified as an hs.styledtext object. textLineBreak- Default wordWrap. A string specifying how to wrap text which exceeds the canvas element's frame for an element of type text. This field is ignored if the text is specified as an hs.styledtext object. Valid values for this attribute are: wordWrap- wrap at word boundaries, unless the word itself doesn’t fit on a single line charWrap- wrap before the first character that doesn’t fit clip- do not draw past the edge of the drawing object frame truncateHead- the line is displayed so that the end fits in the frame and the missing text at the beginning of the line is indicated by an ellipsis truncateTail- the line is displayed so that the beginning fits in the frame and the missing text at the end of the line is indicated by an ellipsis truncateMiddle- the line is displayed so that the beginning and end fit in the frame and the missing text in the middle is indicated by an ellipsis textSize- Default 27.0. Specifies the font size to use when displaying the text element type, if the text is specified as a string. This field is ignored if the text is specified as an hs.styledtext object. trackMouseByBounds- Default false. If true, mouse events are based on the element's bounds (smallest rectangle which completely contains the element); otherwise, mouse events are based on the visible portion of the canvas element. trackMouseEnterExit- Default false. Generates a callback when the mouse enters or exits the canvas element. For canvas and text types, the frame of the element defines the boundaries of the tracking area. trackMouseDown- Default false. Generates a callback when mouse button is clicked down while the cursor is within the canvas element. For canvas and text types, the frame of the element defines the boundaries of the tracking area. trackMouseUp- Default false. Generates a callback when mouse button is released while the cursor is within the canvas element. For canvas and text types, the frame of the element defines the boundaries of the tracking area. trackMouseMove- Default false. Generates a callback when the mouse cursor moves within the canvas element. For canvas and text types, the frame of the element defines the boundaries of the tracking area. transformation- Default { m11 = 1.0, m12 = 0.0, m21 = 0.0, m22 = 1.0, tX = 0.0, tY = 0.0 }. Specifies a matrix transformation to apply to the element before displaying it. Transformations may include rotation, translation, scaling, skewing, etc. windingRule- Default \"nonZero\". A string specifying the winding rule in effect for the canvas element. May be \"nonZero\" or \"evenOdd\". The winding rule determines which portions of an element to fill. This setting will only have a visible effect on compound elements (built with the build action) or elements of type segments when the object is made from lines which cross. withShadow- Default false. Specifies whether a shadow effect should be applied to the canvas element. Ignored for the text type.","An array-like method for accessing the attributes for the canvas element at the specified index","attributes","Canvas attributes which specify the location and size of canvas elements can be specified with an absolute position or as a percentage of the canvas size.","Canvas Element Attributes","Description","Field","hs.canvas.attributes","hs.canvas.object[index]","hs.canvas.percentages","Metamethods are assigned to the canvas object so that you can refer to individual elements of the canvas as if the canvas object was an array. Each element is represented by a table of key-value pairs, where each key represents an attribute for that element. Valid index numbers range from 1 to hs.canvas:elementCount() when getting an element or getting or setting one of its attributes, and from 1 to hs.canvas:elementCount()+ 1 when assign an element table to an index in the canvas. For example: luac = require(\"hs.canvas\")a = c.new:show()a:insertElement({ type = \"rectangle\", id = \"part1\", fillColor = })a:insertElement({ type = \"circle\", id = \"part2\", fillColor = }) can also be expressed as: luac = require(\"hs.canvas\")a = c.new:show()a[1] = { type = \"rectangle\", id = \"part1\", fillColor = }a[2] = { type = \"circle\", id = \"part2\", fillColor = } You can change a canvas element's attributes using this same style: a[2].fillColor.alpha = .5 will adjust the alpha value for element 2 of the canvas without adjusting any of the other color fields. To replace the color entirely, assign it like this: a[2].fillColor = { white = .5, alpha = .25 } The canvas defaults can also be accessed with the _default field like this: a._default.strokeWidth = 5. Attributes which have a string specified as their id attribute can also be accessed as if the id where a key in the table-like canvas: e.g. a.part2.action = skip It is important to note that these methods are a convenience and that the canvas object is not a true table. The tables are generated dynamically as needed; as such hs.inspect cannot properly display them; however, you can just type in the element or element attribute you wish to see expanded in the Hammerspoon console (or in a print command) to see the assigned attributes, e.g. a[1] or a[2].fillColor, and an inspect-like output will be provided. Attributes which allow using a string to specify a percentage (see percentages) can also be retrieved as their actual number for the canvas's current size by appending _raw to the attribute name, e.g. a[2].frame_raw. Because the canvas object is actually a Lua userdata, and not a real table, you cannot use the table.insert and table.remove functions on it. For inserting or removing an element in any position except at the end of the canvas, you must still use hs.canvas:insertElement and hs.canvas:removeElement. You can, however, remove the last element with a[#a] = nil. To print out all of the elements in the canvas with: for i, v in ipairs(a) do print(v) end. The pairs iterator will also work, and will work on element sub-tables (transformations, fillColor and strokeColor, etc.), but this iterator does not guarantee order.","Notes","object","percentages","Percentages may be assigned to the following attributes: frame- the frame used by the rectangle, oval, ellipticalArc, text, and image types.

The x field will be a percentage of the canvas's width and the y field will be a percentage of the canvas's height. radius- the radius for the circle and arc types.

If no percent sign is present, the percentage is expected in decimal format (e.g. \"1.0\" is the same as \"100%\"). Because a shadow applied to a canvas element is not considered as part of the element's bounds, you can also set the padding attribute to a positive number of points to inset the calculated values by from each edge of the canvas's frame so that the shadow will be fully visible within the canvas, even when an element is set to a width and height of \"100%\".","Signature","Type"]},{"l":"Methods","p":["_accessibilitySubrole","| behavior | | | --------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Signature | hs.canvas:behavior([behavior]) - canvasObject | currentValue | | Type | Method | | Description | Get or set the window behavior settings for the canvas object using labels defined in hs.canvas.windowBehaviors. | | Parameters | behavior - if present, the behavior should be a combination of values found in hs.canvas.windowBehaviors describing the window behavior.

Defaults to nil.","The callback function should expect 3 arguments and optionally return 1: the canvas object itself, a message specifying the type of dragging event, and a table containing details about the item(s) being dragged. The key-value pairs of the details table will be the following: pasteboard- the name of the pasteboard that contains the items being dragged sequence- an integer that uniquely identifies the dragging session. mouse- a point table containing the location of the mouse pointer within the canvas corresponding to when the callback occurred. operation- a table containing string descriptions of the type of dragging the source application supports. Potentially useful for determining if your callback function should accept the dragged item or not.* The possible messages the callback function may receive are as follows:\"enter\" - the user has dragged an item into the canvas. When your callback receives this message, you can optionally return false to indicate that you do not wish to accept the item being dragged.\"exit\" - the user has moved the item out of the canvas; if the previous \"enter\" callback returned false, this message will also occur when the user finally releases the items being dragged.\"receive\" - indicates that the user has released the dragged object while it is still within the canvas frame. When your callback receives this message, you can optionally return false to indicate to the sending application that you do not want to accept the dragged item -- this may affect the animations provided by the sending application. You can use the sequence number in the details table to match up an \"enter\" with an \"exit\" or \"receive\" message. You should capture the details you require from the drag-and-drop operation during the callback for \"receive\" by using the pasteboard field of the details table and the hs.pasteboard module. Because of the nature of \"promised items\", it is not guaranteed that the items will still be on the pasteboard after your callback completes handling this message. A canvas object can only accept drag-and-drop items when its window level is at hs.canvas.windowLevels.dragging or lower. a canvas object can only accept drag-and-drop items when it accepts mouse events. You must define a hs.canvas:mouseCallback function, even if it is only a placeholder, e.g. hs.canvas:mouseCallback(function() end)","The callback function should expect 5 arguments: the canvas object itself, a message specifying the type of mouse event, the canvas element id(or index position in the canvas if the id attribute is not set for the element), the x position of the mouse when the event was triggered within the rendered portion of the canvas element, and the y position of the mouse when the event was triggered within the rendered portion of the canvas element. See also hs.canvas:canvasMouseEvents for tracking mouse events in regions of the canvas not covered by an element with mouse tracking enabled. The following mouse attributes may be set to true for a canvas element and will invoke the callback with the specified message: trackMouseDown- indicates that a callback should be invoked when a mouse button is clicked down on the canvas element. The message will be \"mouseDown\". trackMouseUp- indicates that a callback should be invoked when a mouse button has been released over the canvas element. The message will be \"mouseUp\". trackMouseEnterExit- indicates that a callback should be invoked when the mouse pointer enters or exits the canvas element. The message will be \"mouseEnter\" or \"mouseExit\". trackMouseMove- indicates that a callback should be invoked when the mouse pointer moves within the canvas element. The message will be \"mouseMove\". The callback mechanism uses reverse z-indexing to determine which element will receive the callback -- the topmost element of the canvas which has enabled callbacks for the specified message will be invoked. No distinction is made between the left, right, or other mouse buttons. If you need to determine which specific button was pressed, use hs.eventtap.checkMouseButtons() within your callback to check. The hit point detection occurs by comparing the mouse pointer location to the rendered content of each individual canvas object... if an object which obscures a lower object does not have mouse tracking enabled, the lower object will still receive the event if it does have tracking enabled. Clipping regions which remove content from the visible area of a rendered object are ignored for the purposes of element hit-detection.","The canvas does not have to be visible in order for an image to be generated from it.","the canvas object","the canvasObject","The copy of the canvas will be identical in all respects except: The new canvas will not have a callback function assigned, even if the original canvas does.

This method should always be balanced with a call to hs.drawing.enableScreenUpdates when your updates have been completed. Failure to do so will be logged in the system logs. The window server will only allow you to pause updates for up to 1 second. This prevents a rogue or hung process from locking the systems display completely.

If a file with one of the names is found in the directory, this file is served instead of the directory.","The access-list feature works by comparing the request headers against a list of tests which either accept or reject the request. If no access list is set (i.e. it is assigned a value of nil), then all requests are served. If a table is passed into this method, then any request which is not explicitly accepted by one of the tests provided is rejected (i.e. there is an implicit \"reject\" at the end of the list). The access-list table is a list of tests which are evaluated in order. The first test which matches a given request determines whether or not the request is accepted or rejected. Each entry in the access-list table is also a table with the following format:{ 'header', 'value', isPattern, isAccepted } header - a string value matching the name of a header. While the header name must match exactly, the comparison is case-insensitive (i.e. \"X-Remote-addr\" and \"x-remote-addr\" will both match the actual header name used, which is \"X-Remote-Addr\"). value - a string value specifying the value to compare the header key's value to. isPattern - a boolean indicating whether or not the header key's value should be compared to value as a pattern match (true) -- see Lua documentation 6.4.1, help.lua._man._6_4_1 in the console, or as an exact match (false) isAccepted - a boolean indicating whether or not a match should be accepted (true) or rejected (false) A special entry of the form { '*', '*', '*', true } accepts all further requests and can be used as the final entry if you wish for the access list to function as a list of requests to reject, but to accept any requests which do not match a previous test. A special entry of the form { '*', '*', '*', false } rejects all further requests and can be used as the final entry if you wish for the access list to function as a list of requests to accept, but to reject any requests which do not match a previous test. This is the implicit \"default\" final test if a table is assigned with the access-list method and does not actually need to be specified, but is included for completeness. Note that any entry after an entry in which the first two parameters are equal to '*' will never actually be used. The tests are performed in order; if you wich to allow one IP address in a range, but reject all others, you should list the accepted IP addresses first. For example:~~~{{ 'X-Remote-Addr', '192.168.1.100', false, true }, -- accept requests from 192.168.1.100{ 'X-Remote-Addr', '^ 192%.168%.1%.', true, false }, -- reject all others from the 192.168.1 subnet{ '', '', '*', true } -- accept all other requests}~~~ Most of the headers available are provided by the requesting web browser, so the exact headers available will vary. You can find some information about common HTTP request headers at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields. The following headers are inserted automatically by hs.httpserver and are probably the most useful for use in an access list: X-Remote-Addr - the remote IPv4 or IPv6 address of the machine making the request, X-Remote-Port - the TCP port of the remote machine where the request originated. X-Server-Addr - the server IPv4 or IPv6 address that the web server received the request from. For machines with multiple interfaces, this will allow you to determine which interface the request was received on. X-Server-Port - the TCP port of the web server that received the request.","the hsminWebTable object","the hsminwebTable object if a parameter is provided, or a boolean indicating whether or not a password has been set if no parameter is specified.","the hsminwebTable object if a parameter is provided, or the current value if no parameter is specified.","the password, if set, is server wide and causes the server to use the Basic authentication scheme with an empty string for the username. this module is an extension to the Hammerspoon core module hs.httpserver, so it has the same limitations regarding server passwords.

This is the first directory which contains files or sub-directories which are served by the web server.\"DOCUMENT_URI\" - the path portion of the HTTP URL requested\"GATEWAY_INTERFACE\" - The revision of the CGI specification to which this server complies. Format: CGI/revision\"PATH_INFO\" - The extra path information, as given by the client. In other words, scripts can be accessed by their virtual pathname, followed by extra information at the end of this path. The extra information is sent as PATH_INFO. This information should be decoded by the server if it comes from a URL before it is passed to the CGI script.\"PATH_TRANSLATED\" - The server provides a translated version of PATH_INFO, which takes the path and does any virtual-to-physical mapping to it.\"QUERY_STRING\" - The information which follows the \"?\" in the URL which referenced this script. This is the query information. It should not be decoded in any fashion. This variable should always be set when there is query information, regardless of command line decoding.\"REMOTE_ADDR\" - The IP address of the remote host making the request.\"REMOTE_HOST\" - The hostname making the request. If the server does not have this information, it should set REMOTE_ADDR and leave this unset.\"REMOTE_IDENT\" - If the HTTP server supports RFC 931 identification, then this variable will be set to the remote user name retrieved from the server. Usage of this variable should be limited to logging only.\"REMOTE_USER\" - If the server supports user authentication, and the script is protected, this is the username they have authenticated as.\"REQUEST_METHOD\" - The method with which the request was made. For HTTP, this is \"GET\", \"HEAD\", \"POST\", etc.\"REQUEST_TIME\" - the time the server received the request represented as the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970. Usable with os.date to provide the date and time in whatever format you require.\"REQUEST_URI\" - the DOCUMENT_URI with any query string present in the request appended. Usually this corresponds to the URL without the scheme or host information.\"SCRIPT_FILENAME\" - the actual path to the script being executed.\"SCRIPT_NAME\" - A virtual path to the script being executed, used for self-referencing URLs.\"SERVER_NAME\" - The server's hostname, DNS alias, or IP address as it would appear in self-referencing URLs.\"SERVER_PORT\" - The port number to which the request was sent.\"SERVER_PROTOCOL\" - The name and revision of the information protocol this request came in with.

This is usually different than the Hammerspoon default directory which corresponds to the directory which contains the init.lua file for Hammerspoon.* The default template environment provides the following: the __index metamethod points to the _G environment variable in the Hammerspoon Lua instance; this means that any global variable in the Hammerspoon environment is available to the lua code in a template file. the __newindex metamethod points to a function which creates new \"global\" variables in the template files environment; this means that if a template includes another template file, and that second template file creates a \"global\" variable, that new variable will be available in the environment of the calling template, but will not be shared with the Hammerspoon global variable space; \"global\" variables created in this manner will be released when the HTTP request is completed. print is overridden so that its output is streamed into the response body to be returned when the web request completes. It follows the traditional pattern of the print builtin function: multiple arguments are separated by a tab character, the output is terminated with a new-line character, non-string arguments are converted to strings via the tostring builtin function. write is defined as an alternative to print and differs in the following ways from the print function described above: no intermediate tabs or newline are included in the output streamed to the response body. cgilua is defined as a table containing all of the functions included in this support sub-module. hsminweb is defined as a table which contains the following tables which may be of use: CGIVariables - a table containing key-value pairs of the same data available through the cgilua.servervariable function. id - a string, generated via hs.host.globallyUniqueString, unique to this specific HTTP request. log - a table/object representing the hs.httpserver.hsminweb instance of hs.logger. This can be used to log messages to the Hammerspoon console as described in the documentation for hs.logger. request - a table containing data representing the details of the HTTP request as it was made by the web client to the server. The following keys are commonly found: headers - a table containing key-value pairs representing the headers included in the HTTP request; unlike the values available through cgilua.servervariable or found in CGIVariables, these are available in their raw form. this table also contains a table with the key \"_\". This table contains functions and data used internally, and is described more fully in a supporting document (TBD). It is targeted primarily at custom error functions designed for use with hs.httpserver.hsminweb and should not generally be necessary for Lua template files. method - the method of the HTTP request, most commonly \"GET\" or \"POST\" path - the path portion of the requested URL. response - a table containing data representing the response being formed for the response to the HTTP request. This is generally handled for you by the cgilua support functions, but for special cases, you can modify it directly; this should contain only the following keys: body - a string containing the response body. As the lua template outputs content, this string is appended to. code - an integer representing the currently expected response code for the HTTP request. headers - a table containing key-value pairs of the currently defined response headers_ tmpfiles - used internally to track temporary files used in the completion of this HTTP request; do not modify directly.","A lua function which should take no arguments.","compile","Converts the specified Lua template source into a Lua function.","Converts the specified Lua template source into Lua code executable within the Hammerspoon environment.","Description","file - a string containing the file system path to the template to include. env - an optional table specifying the environment to be used by the included template.

The format of the table is documented below If this argument is a function: The function will be called each time the user clicks on the menubar item and the function should return a table that specifies the menu to be displayed. The table should be of the same format as described below.

If this is the special string - the item will be rendered as a menu separator. This key can be set to the empty string (\"\"), but it must be present. fn - A function to be executed when the menu item is clicked. The function will be called with two arguments. The first argument will be a table containing boolean values indicating which keyboard modifiers were held down when the menubar item was clicked (see menuTable parameter for possible keys) and the second is the table representing the item. checked - A boolean to indicate if the menu item should have a checkmark (by default) next to it or not. Defaults to false. state - a text value of \"on\", \"off\", or \"mixed\" indicating the menu item state. \"on\" and \"off\" are equivalent to checked being true or false respectively, and \"mixed\" will have a dash (by default) beside it. disabled - A boolean to indicate if the menu item should be unselectable or not. Defaults to false (i.e. menu items are selectable by default) menu - a table, in the same format as above, which will be presented as a sub-menu for this menu item.A menu item that is disabled and has a sub-menu will show the arrow at the right indicating that it has a sub-menu, but the items within the sub-menu will not be available, even if the sub-menu items are not disabled themselves.A menu item with a sub-menu is also a clickable target, so it can also have an fn key. image - An image to display in the menu to the right of any state image or checkmark and to the left of the menu item title. This image is not constrained by the size set with hs.menubar:stateImageSize, so you should adjust it with hs.image:setSize if your image is extremely large or small. tooltip - A tool tip to display if you hover the cursor over a menu item for a few seconds. shortcut - A string containing a single character, which will be used as the keyboard shortcut for the menu item. Note that if you use a capital letter, the Shift key will be required to activate the shortcut. indent - An integer from 0 to 15 indicating how far to the right a menu item should be indented. Defaults to 0. onStateImage - An image to display when checked is true or state is set to \"on\". This image size is constrained to the size set by hs.menubar:stateImageSize. If this key is not set, a checkmark will be displayed for checked or \"on\" menu items. offStateImage - An image to display when checked is false or state is set to \"off\". This image size is constrained to the size set by hs.menubar:stateImageSize. If this key is not set, no special marking appears next to the menu item. mixedStateImage - An image to display when state is set to \"mixed\".

Defaults to 0, which sends the command to All Channels. fourteenBitValue - The 14-bit value of the command. Must be between 0 and 16383. Defaults to 0. fourteenBitCommand must be true. fourteenBitCommand - true if the command contains 14-bit value data otherwise, false. controllerValue will be ignored if this is set to true. programChange- Program change command: programNumber - The program (aka patch) number. From 0-127. Defaults to 0. channel - The channel for the command. Must be a number between 0 and 16. Defaults to 0, which sends the command to All Channels. channelPressure- Channel pressure command: pressure - Key pressure of the channel pressure message. In the range 0-127. Defaults to 0. channel - The channel for the command. Must be a number between 0 and 16. Defaults to 0, which sends the command to All Channels. pitchWheelChange- Pitch wheel change command: pitchChange - A 14-bit value indicating the pitch bend. Center is 0x2000 (8192). Valid range is from 0-16383. Defaults to 0. channel - The channel for the command. Must be a number between 0 and 16. Defaults to 0, which sends the command to All Channels.

Because this watcher works by listening for posted messages, should Apple remove this notification, your callback function will no longer receive messages about this change -- it won't crash or change behavior in any other way.

Because the HTTP specification requires that both keys and values are strings, any key which is not a string is ignored, and any value which is not a string or number is also ignored. In addition, the following keys are handled automatically behind the scenes and will be ignored if you specify them:Authorization``Connection``Host``WWW-Authenticate``Content-Length | | Returns | If a URL is specified, then this method returns the webview Object; otherwise it returns the current url being displayed. | | Notes | The networkServiceType field of the URL request table is a hint to the operating system about what the underlying traffic is used for. This hint enhances the system's ability to prioritize traffic, determine how quickly it needs to wake up the Wi-Fi radio, and so on. By providing accurate information, you improve the ability of the system to optimally balance battery life, performance, and other considerations.

This key cannot be changed after an item has been created. allowedAlone- a boolean value, default true, specifying whether or not the toolbar item can be added to the toolbar, programmatically or through the customization panel, (true) or whether it can only be added as a member of a group (false). default- a boolean value, default matching the value of allowedAlone for this item, indicating whether or not this toolbar item or group should be displayed in the toolbar by default, unless overridden by user customization or a saved configuration (when such options are enabled). enable- a boolean value, default true, indicating whether or not the toolbar item is active (and can be clicked on) or inactive and greyed out. This field is ignored when applied to a toolbar group; apply it to the group members instead. fn- a callback function, or false to remove, specific to the toolbar item. This property is ignored if assigned to the button group. This function will override the toolbar callback defined with hs.webview.toolbar:setCallback for this specific item. The function should expect three (four, if the item is a searchfield) arguments and return none. See hs.webview.toolbar:setCallback for information about the callback's arguments. groupMembers- an array (table) of strings specifying the toolbar item ids that are members of this toolbar item group. If set to false, this field is removed and the item is reset back to being a regular toolbar item. Note that you cannot change a currently visible toolbar item to or from being a group; it must first be removed from active toolbar with hs.webview.toolbar:removeItem. image- an hs.image object, or false to remove, specifying the image to use as the toolbar item's icon when icon's are displayed in the toolbar or customization panel. This key is ignored for a toolbar item group, but not for it's individual members. label- a string label, or false to remove, for the toolbar item or group when text is displayed in the toolbar or in the customization panel. For a toolbar item, the default is the id string; for a group, the default is false. If a group has a label assigned to it, the group label will be displayed for the group of items it contains. If a group does not have a label, the individual items which make up the group will each display their individual labels. priority- an integer value used to determine toolbar item order and which items are displayed or put into the overflow menu when the number of items in the toolbar exceed the width of the window in which the toolbar is attached. Some example values are provided in the hs.webview.toolbar.itemPriorities table. If a toolbar item is in a group, it's priority is ignored and the item group is ordered by the item group's priority. searchfield- a boolean (default false) specifying whether or not this toolbar item is a search field. If true, the following additional keys are allowed: searchHistory- an array (table) of strings, specifying previous searches to automatically include in the search field menu, if searchPredefinedMenuTitle is not false searchHistoryAutosaveName- a string specifying the key name to save search history with in the application defaults (accessible through hs.settings). If this value is set, search history will be maintained through restarts of Hammerspoon. searchHistoryLimit- the maximum number of items to store in the search field history. searchPredefinedMenuTitle- a string or boolean specifying how a predefined list of search field \"response\" should be included in the search field menu. If this item is true, this list of items specified for searchPredefinedSearches will be displayed in a submenu with the title \"Predefined Searches\". If this item is a string, the list of items will be displayed in a submenu with the title specified by this string value. If this item is false, then the search field menu will only contain the items specified in searchPredefinedSearches and no search history will be included in the menu. searchPredefinedSearches- an array (table) of strings specifying the items to be listed in the predefined search submenu.

As binary data, even when cleaned up with the Console's UTF8 wrapper code, some valid UTF8 sequences have been found to cause crashes in the OSX CoreText API during rendering. While some specific sequences have made the rounds on the Internet, the specific code analysis at http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/05/27/text_message_unicode_ios_osx_vulnerability/ suggests a possible cause of the problem which may be triggered by other currently unknown sequences as well.
