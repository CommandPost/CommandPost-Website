basically just need to toggle a boolean hidden within a preference file inside the Final Cut Pro Library.","In the early days of FCPX Hacks we added an option for Moveable Markers which enables them using the same technique Alex found, except it allowed users to easily toggle the feature on and off using the menu bar or shortcut keys.","When we transitioned FCPX Hacks to CommandPost, we kept this feature, however we've since decided that it's probably a bad idea to modify the contents of the Final Cut Pro application bundle, so we removed this feature all together, along with other features that modify the contents of the Final Cut Pro application bundle (such as inserting our commands into the Final Cut Pro Command Editor).","We want CommandPost to be as safe and reliable as possible, and we want to avoid using \"hacks\" to make things happen.","The easiest way to enable Moveable Markers is via Terminal.","This works on Final Cut Pro 10.5.2 and below on both Intel and Apple Silicon.","The below assumes you have Final Cut Pro installed within the /Applications folder.","This will enable them:","sudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c Set :TLKMarkerHandler:Configuration:'Allow

We all know what “Picture Lock” is.","Picture lock is a stage in editing a film or editing a television production. It is the stage prior to online editing when all changes to the film or television program cut have been done and approved. It is then sent to subsequent stages in the process, such as online editing and audio mixing. Any last-minute changes can force portions of subsequent work to be redone.","Source: Wikipedia","In an analogous fashion, Sound Lock is a stage in a film or editing a television production where a sequence is edited before the production starts principal photography. In other words, before the project is being shot, in the pre-production or development stage. You could call it “Pre-Editing” as well. The filmmaker would use a series of concept images to construct a timeline."]},{"i":"what-is-sound-locking","l":"What is Sound Locking?","p":["Now, you might ask, where does the Sound component come in? In projects like Music Video, music follows higher precedence over visuals. Not that the visuals are not important, but in 99% of all Music Videos, the music will always be composed and recorded first. Thus, with that piece of the Music, it becomes the “Locked” component. It will never change. The filmmaker now uses that music track as an anchor point to construct the matching visual or rather envisioned visuals against that music right within the NLE. These envisioned visuals could come as a set of reference images, hand-drawn sketches or even 3D generated shots. It mostly revolves around the filmmaker’s workflow.","Sound Locking is not an entirely a new concept. Filmmakers, Music Video Directors and the animation industry have utilised this technique for a long time. The biggest hurdle from the above mentioned workflow is, there is no path to bring shot and scene information out from NLE to on-set usage meaningfully. Even if you have edited and prepared the sequence, the only method within the NLE is to export that sequence out as a rendered video file. It is not entirely useful, and shot information is not entirely homogenous. You are also required to do a Shot List manually based on the envisioned visuals. Which would precipitate tons of physical print out for various departments in productions, which yields a non eco-friendly work practice.","However, there are applications on the market like Shot Lister, Studio Binder or Celtx that allow you to develop industry standard Shot Lists. But all seems to tackle the Shot List construction from a script level. There is undoubtedly nothing wrong with this approach. The script is the anchor point, as screenplay is the foundation of every production.","For Music Videos and music driven narratives, sound or music invariably takes higher precedence. You can’t visualise music on a sheet of paper except on a musical score sheet and you can’t conceivably construct a Shot List from a score sheet."]},{"l":"The Most Resilient Parasite","p":["What is the most resilient parasite?
