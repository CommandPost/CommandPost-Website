# User Guide

## Installation

You can download the latest release as an DMG package [here](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost/releases/latest).

Once downloaded, simply open the package by double-clicking it, then drag the CommandPost Application into your Applications folder on your Mac.

You can then double click on the CommandPost application to open it.

## Assessibility Permissions

CommandPost makes use of the macOS Accessibility Frameworks to control Final Cut Pro. This is called GUI Scripting.

When you first run CommandPost, you'll be prompted with the following alert:

![CommandPost Accessibility Dialog Box](http://commandpost.io/assets/images/cp-accessibility-alert-01.png "CommandPost Accessibility Dialog Box")

When you click OK, you'll then be presented with another alert:

![CommandPost Accessibility Dialog Box](http://commandpost.io/assets/images/cp-accessibility-alert-02.png "CommandPost Accessibility Dialog Box")

...to be continued.
