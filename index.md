# Introduction

CommandPost is a **free** and [**open source**](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost/blob/develop/LICENSE.md) Mac application that allows you to seriously speed up your creative editing process through powerful and customisable automation tools. Think Apple's [Automator](https://macosxautomation.com/automator/), with a little bit of [BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net) and [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com) thrown in, but specifically designed for creative professionals.

It's currently focussed on Apple's [Final Cut Pro](http://apple.com/final-cut-pro/) - however the road-map is to add useful functionality for other tools we use on a daily basis, like [Adobe After Effects](http://www.adobe.com/au/products/aftereffects.html), [mocha Pro](http://www.imagineersystems.com/products/mocha-pro/) and [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve).

Built on-top of a powerful and flexible plugin architecture, the aim of CommandPost is to build an **open platform** where editors worldwide can easily create and share useful tools to make their editing lives easier - allowing them to spend less time worrying about keystrokes, and more time doing creative things. We want to remove boring workflow obstacles so that everyone can **get home earlier** and spend **less** time in front of a computer.

For those that know how to do basic coding, building plugins for CommandPost will also be a breeze, as they're created using the powerful, fast, and easy-to-learn [Lua](https://dev.commandpost.io/lua/overview/) - the same scripting language used by [Blackmagic Fusion](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/fusion/), [Adobe Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/au/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) and even parts of [Apple iOS](https://twitter.com/_inside/status/1026173832527265792). It's also fully compatible with [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org).

You can listen to Chris explain CommandPost on Final Cut Pro Radio [Episode #57](http://fcpradio.com/episode057.html) and [Episode #43](http://fcpradio.com/episodes/episode043.html).

# Authors

CommandPost was originally thrown together by [Chris Hocking](https://github.com/latenitefilms) as a proof-of-concept to make finding the Final Cut Pro browser playhead easier for [Scott Simmons](http://www.scottsimmons.tv/) (you can read the origin story [here](https://latenitefilms.com/blog/final-cut-pro-hacks/)).

It's now developed and maintained by [Chris Hocking](https://github.com/latenitefilms) & [David Peterson](https://github.com/randomeizer) through [GitHub](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost).
