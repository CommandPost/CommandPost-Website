# Introduction

CommandPost is a **free** and [**open source**](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost/blob/develop/LICENSE.md) Mac application that allows you to seriously speed up your creative editing process through powerful and customisable automation tools. Think Apple's [Automator](https://macosxautomation.com/automator/), with a little bit of [BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net) and [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com) thrown in, but specifically designed for creative professionals.

CommandPost has over <span style="color: #e8a75d;">**3300 active monthly users**</span> and over <span style="color: #e8a75d;">**1231 users**</span> in our [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/commandpost/).

Built on-top of a powerful and flexible plugin architecture, CommandPost provides an **open platform** where editors worldwide can easily create and share useful tools to make their editing lives easier - allowing them to spend less time worrying about keystrokes, and more time doing creative things. We want to remove boring workflow obstacles so that everyone can **get home earlier** and spend **less** time in front of a computer.

For those that know how to do basic coding, building plugins for CommandPost will also be a breeze, as they're created using the powerful, fast, and easy-to-learn [Lua](https://dev.commandpost.io/lua/overview/) - the same scripting language used by [Blackmagic Fusion](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/fusion/), [Adobe Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/au/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) and even parts of [Apple iOS](https://twitter.com/_inside/status/1026173832527265792). It's also fully compatible with [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org).

It's currently focussed on Apple's [Final Cut Pro](http://apple.com/final-cut-pro/), however the road-map is to add useful functionality for other tools we use on a daily basis, like [Adobe After Effects](http://www.adobe.com/au/products/aftereffects.html), [mocha Pro](http://www.imagineersystems.com/products/mocha-pro/) and [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve).

You can listen to Chris explain CommandPost on Final Cut Pro Radio [Episode #57](http://fcpradio.com/episode057.html) and [Episode #43](http://fcpradio.com/episodes/episode043.html).

# Sponsor

To help continue CommandPost to grow, evolve, and stay completely free and open-source, we offer the ability to sponsor CommandPost directly through GitHub.

**GitHub will kindly match user contributions up to USD$5,000 until November 2020.**

GitHub also covers all the transaction costs, so 100% of your contribution hits our bank account.

If we can raise $5K for both Chris & David, this means GitHub will double the amount, and we can dedicate a couple of months to CommandPost development.

- You can sponsor Chris on GitHub [here](https://github.com/sponsors/latenitefilms).
- You can sponsor David on GitHub [here](https://github.com/sponsors/randomeizer).

GitHub Sponsors works on a monthly subscription model, but you can cancel at any time, so you can just make one big donation and cancel after a month, or do smaller monthly contributions.

If you're new to GitHub you may be presented with a "Your GitHub Sponsors contribution will not be matched at this time" warning. This is just temporary, as GitHub needs to verify brand new accounts internally to prevent fraud and abuse. Once verified your contributions will be matched.

Alternatively, you can also make a donation via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=HQK87KLKY8EVN) (but would prefer you did a one-off payment through GitHub instead so they match your donation).

You can read the GitHub Sponsors FAQ [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/supporting-the-open-source-community-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors).
