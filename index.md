# Introduction

CommandPost is a **free** and [open source](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost/blob/develop/LICENSE.md) native macOS application that acts as a bridge between control surfaces, and software that doesn't natively support control surfaces, such as [Apple's Final Cut Pro X](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/) and Adobe After Effects.

There are currently over <span style="color: #e8a75d;">**3300 active monthly users**</span> and over <span style="color: #e8a75d;">**1906 users**</span> in our [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/commandpost/).

It's used by filmmakers, scientists and just general macOS fans all over the world to seriously speed up mundane tasks through powerful and customisable automation tools.

For example, you can apply individual effects within Final Cut Pro or After Effects with the single tap of a button. It also has powerful Windows management tools.

Developed in [Lua](https://dev.commandpost.io/lua/overview/) (the same scripting language used by [Blackmagic Fusion](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/fusion/), [Adobe Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/au/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) and even parts of [Apple iOS](https://twitter.com/_inside/status/1026173832527265792)), it's insanely customisable and powerful.

It's also fully compatible with [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org).

You can listen to Chris explain CommandPost on Final Cut Pro Radio [Episode #57](http://fcpradio.com/episode057.html) and [Episode #43](http://fcpradio.com/episodes/episode043.html).

# Custom Tools

If you have a specific post production workflow problem you need to solve or automate, we can help.

We've developed custom plugins and solutions for post production studios, production companies, and individual editors all over the world.

For example, we developed a transcription plugin for [Apollo: Missions to the Moon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9782756/) (edited by [David Tillman](https://twitter.com/davidtillman)) as well as specific CommandPost features for Denmark's second largest production company, [Metronome Productions](http://www.fcp.co/final-cut-pro/news/867-metronome-celebrate-a-documentary-series-cut-on-fcpx-with-a-birthday-cake).

The **FCPXML Titles Processor**, and **Shot Data** in CommandPost's Toolbox are other examples of commissioned tools.

# Credits

CommandPost was originally created by [Chris Hocking](https://github.com/latenitefilms) as a proof-of-concept to make finding the Final Cut Pro browser playhead easier for [Scott Simmons](http://www.scottsimmons.tv/) (you can read the origin story [here](https://latenitefilms.com/blog/final-cut-pro-hacks/)).

It's now developed, maintained and supported by [Chris Hocking](https://github.com/latenitefilms) & [David Peterson](https://github.com/randomeizer) through [GitHub](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost).
