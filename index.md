# Introduction

CommandPost is a **free** and [open source](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost/blob/develop/LICENSE.md) macOS application that bridges between control surfaces and software that doesn’t support them natively, such as Apple’s [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/) and Adobe’s [After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html).

It’s been downloaded over [132 thousand times](https://hanadigital.github.io/grev/?user=commandpost&repo=commandpost), and there are over [2.4 thousands members](https://www.facebook.com/groups/commandpost/members) in our [Facebook Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/commandpost/).

It’s been translated into Arabic, Bengali, Catalan, Chinese (Simplified & Traditional), Danish, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malayalam, Norwegian, Panjabi/Punjabi, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Ukrainian & Vietnamese by [our awesome community](https://poeditor.com/join/project/QWvOQlF1Sy).

It’s used by filmmakers, developers, scientists and macOS power users all over the world to seriously speed up mundane tasks through powerful and customisable automation tools.

For example, you can apply individual effects within Final Cut Pro or After Effects with the single tap of a button.

Powered by [Lua](https://dev.commandpost.io/lua/overview/) (the same scripting language used by [Blackmagic Fusion](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/fusion/), [Adobe Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/au/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) and even parts of [Apple iOS](https://twitter.com/_inside/status/1026173832527265792)), it's insanely customisable and powerful.

It runs natively on Apple Silicon and is fully compatible with [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org).

You can listen to Chris explain CommandPost on Final Cut Pro Radio [Episode #57](http://fcpradio.com/episode057.html) and [Episode #43](http://fcpradio.com/episodes/episode043.html).

# System Requirements

CommandPost supports **macOS Catalina, Big Sur & Monterey**.

It has **native** support for both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

We use Apple’s built-in Accessibility API, which requires both **Accessibility** and **Screen Recording** permissions, so that we can determine window and button positions.

If you're using **Mojave**, you can still access older versions [here](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost/releases/tag/1.2.16).

---

# Applications

You can use CommandPost to trigger keyboard shortcuts and menubar items on **any** macOS application.

CommandPost also has deep support for **Final Cut Pro 10.5.4** to **10.6.2**.

It has basic support for **Adobe After Effects 2020** and later.

It has limited experimental support for **DaVinci Resolve 16.2.7** and later. If there's enough interest/sponsorship, we hope to offer much better Resolve support in the future.

If you're using an earlier version of Final Cut Pro, you can use an [older version of CommandPost](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost/releases/tag/1.2.16).

# Custom Tools

If you have a specific post production workflow problem you need to solve or automate, we can help.

We’ve developed custom plugins and solutions for post production studios, production companies, and individual editors all over the world.

For example, we developed a transcription plugin for [Apollo: Missions to the Moon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9782756/) (edited by [David Tillman](https://twitter.com/davidtillman)) as well as specific CommandPost features for Denmark’s second largest production company, [Metronome Productions](http://www.fcp.co/final-cut-pro/news/867-metronome-celebrate-a-documentary-series-cut-on-fcpx-with-a-birthday-cake).

The **FCPXML Titles Processor**, **Shot Data** and **Titles to Keywords** in CommandPost’s Toolbox are other examples of commissioned tools.

[Email us](mailto:team@commandpost.io?subject=Custom Tools) to discuss your specific requirements.

It’s now developed, maintained and supported by [Chris Hocking](https://github.com/latenitefilms) & [David Peterson](https://github.com/randomeizer) through [GitHub](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost).
