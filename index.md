# Introduction:

CommandPost is a completely **free** and **open source** Mac application that allows you to seriously speed up your creative editing process through powerful and customisable automation tools - it's basically [Automator](https://macosxautomation.com/automator/) for editors. It's currently focussed on Apple's [Final Cut Pro](http://apple.com/final-cut-pro/) - however the plan is to eventually add useful functionality for other tools we use on a daily basis, like [Adobe After Effects](http://www.adobe.com/au/products/aftereffects.html) and [mocha Pro](http://www.imagineersystems.com/products/mocha-pro/).

It originally started off as a little proof of concept project to make finding the Final Cut Pro browser playhead easier for [Scott Simmons](http://www.scottsimmons.tv/) (you can read the origin story [here](https://latenitefilms.com/blog/final-cut-pro-hacks/)) – but has since grown into a HUGE collection of handy professional workflow tools and unique automation features to make editing within Final Cut Pro faster, easier and much more powerful. And this is just the beginning...

With the addition of a powerful plugin architecture, the aim of CommandPost is to build an **open platform** where editors worldwide can easily create and share useful tools to make their editing lives easier - allowing them to spend less time worrying about keystrokes, and more time doing creative things. We want to remove boring workflow obstacles so that everyone can **get home earlier** and spend **less** time in front of a computer.
