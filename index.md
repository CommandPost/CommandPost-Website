# Introduction:

CommandPost is a free and open source application that adds a mountain-load of new features to Apple's [Final Cut Pro](http://apple.com/final-cut-pro/). It originally started off as a little proof of concept project to make finding the browser playhead easier for [Scott Simmons](http://www.scottsimmons.tv/) (read the [original blog](https://latenitefilms.com/blog/final-cut-pro-hacks/)) – but has since grown into a huge collection of handy professional workflow tools and automation features to make editing within Final Cut Pro faster, easier and much more powerful.

# Installation:

Download the latest version of CommandPost [here](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost/releases/latest).

# User Guide:

You can learn about CommandPost's feature [here](http://commandpost.io/userguide/).

# System Requirements:

CommandPost requires **Final Cut Pro 10.3** (or above). It will not work on any previous versions of Final Cut Pro.

It’s compatible with **macOS 10.10.5** (or above), and works with any language and keyboard layout.

The Touch Bar feature requires [macOS Sierra 10.12.1 build 16B2657](https://support.apple.com/kb/dl1897) (or above).

We recommend changing the CommandPost Notification alert style to Alerts. This can be done in the Notifications section of macOS System Preferences once CommandPost has been installed.
